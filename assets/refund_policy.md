Refund and Cancellation Policy
Your purchase of ERP (Enterprise resource planning) and other services indicates your commitment to participate in the process and follow through to its conclusion. However, we also understand that unexpected events can happen. In addition to the general guidelines outlined below, refunds and cancellations will be considered on an individual basis.
In general these guidelines apply for Class refunds and cancellations:
The Client (Mainly Educational Institutions are our clients) may cancel our Services within 30 days of staring and request a refund. The refund will be issued, minus a 5% cancellation fee according to plan they choose.
To cancel our services, send your request to info@classonapp.com or contact your account Manager. As Per Company Policy, we don’t ask any single question for cancellation.
Once we receive your request of returning back the access of a service (Deactivation of a service), we will inspect it and notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the request.
If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your bank account (or original method of payment) within 48 days.
